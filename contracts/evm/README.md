# Robinhood rental escrow proof

This is an immutable per-tenancy escrow with a narrow Morpho vault adapter. It implements agreement acceptance, fixed-asset funding, supply-only lending, policy-bounded earnings release, tenant-approved claims, assigned arbitration, and separately executed settlement. The escrow has no operator withdrawal key, upgrade method, arbitrary executor, or authority over a personal portfolio.

All amounts are native atomic integers. USDG uses 6 decimals; the selected Morpho vault uses 18-decimal shares. Claim payments cannot exceed the requested claim or security requirement. A settlement records a minimum total asset value: losses below that floor stop payment until the decision is revisited. Residual earnings return with the tenant's security. Closed escrow donations can only return to the fixed tenant.

## Sponsor-paid rental actions

Both direct native methods and a bounded EIP-712 relay are implemented. The latter allows an unrelated sponsor to pay transaction gas while the tenant, landlord, or assigned arbitrator signs the exact permitted action. EOA signatures enforce low-S and valid V; deployed contract role wallets use ERC-1271. There is no arbitrary target, native value, or call data in a signed action.

Domain: `name=RentalEscrow`, `version=1`, immutable `chainId`, and `verifyingContract=escrow`.

| 0 | Accept agreement | 0 | 0 | Zero hash |
| 1 | Fund fixed security | 0 | 0 | Zero hash |
| 2 | Supply | Underlying assets | Minimum shares | Zero hash |
| 3 | Release earnings | Underlying assets | Maximum burned shares | Zero hash |
| 4 | Propose claim | Requested assets | 0 | Private evidence digest |
| 5 | Accept claim | 0 | Minimum settlement assets | Zero hash |
| 6 | Contest claim | 0 | 0 | Zero hash |
| 7 | Resolve claim | Landlord award | Minimum settlement assets | Zero hash |
| 8 | Execute settlement | 0 | Minimum assets from redemption | Zero hash |

Every action binds the current global escrow nonce and an expiry. An unsuccessful action reverts its nonce and state. A successful signed action emits both its ordinary financial event and `SignedOperationExecuted`, allowing reconciliation to verify the authorization digest as well as the effect. The sponsor has no independent trading signature.

This is the implemented sponsorship choice; it does not claim working Safe4337, Pimlico, or a configured wallet provider. Initial USDG approval and personal-wallet stock trades/withdrawals require their own supported sponsorship path. A preapproved local test wallet is not proof of gasless consumer onboarding. ERC-1271 support is verified with a local contract-wallet fixture, not an installed Safe.

## Commands

From `contracts/evm`, with Foundry and Solc 0.8.28:

```sh
forge test --offline -vv
forge script script/LocalProof.s.sol:LocalProof --offline --sig 'run()' -vv
```

On a fresh environment, allow Foundry to obtain the pinned compiler before using `--offline`. That flag also avoids an observed Foundry 1.4.4/macOS proxy-detection crash. No containers are needed. The script requires chain 31337 and uses public fixture keys. Without `--broadcast` it executes only in Foundry's local EVM. It returns a test token, mock vault and settled escrow; it is not a Robinhood deployment. To leave an interactive escrow before funding, deploy the contracts from the application deployment tooling rather than presenting this completed script as a new tenancy.

From the repository root:

```sh
node --experimental-strip-types --test src/finance/robinhood/native.test.ts
```

## Verified evidence on September 22, 2026

**25 local contract tests passed**, including 256 fuzz runs for conservation. Coverage includes the 3,000 → 10 earnings → 120 claim → 2,880 security refund scenario; separated personal funds; incorrect roles; claim caps; partial losses; stale nonces; expiry and chain mismatch; share slippage; failed withdrawals; callback reentrancy; EIP-712 tampering; cross-contract replay; malformed/high-S signatures; and ERC-1271 authorization. **14 TypeScript tests and strict typechecking passed** for native plans, typed relay encoding, canonical receipt reconciliation, exact amounts, accumulating exposure, and gated quote validation.

**Two tests also passed against a pinned Robinhood mainnet fork at block 69,829,067.** They executed the actual USDG token and selected Steakhouse USDG vault locally through the new escrow. Source addresses:

- USDG: `0x5fc5360D0400a0Fd4f2af552ADD042D716F1d168`.
- Morpho vault: `0xBeEff033F34C046626B8D0A041844C5d1A5409dd`.
- SPY metadata/multiplier read: `0x117cc2133c37B721F49dE2A7a74833232B3B4C0C`. No stock trade was executed.

| Fork observation | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Declared local security fixture | 3,000 USDG |
| Separate local rounding buffer | 1 USDG |
| Vault shares minted | 2,976.933803835862343805 |
| Eligible earnings after **90 days of synthetic time progression** | 40.743012 USDG |
| Earnings released into personal wallet | 10 USDG |
| Landlord settlement | 120 USDG |
| Tenant settlement, including residual earnings and buffer | 2,911.743012 USDG |
| Remaining escrow shares | 0 |

These are local fork results, not realized mainnet returns or a forecast. The fixture changes the tenant's local token balance and local time; no transaction is broadcast to Robinhood. Morpho V2's transient per-transaction accrual cache requires deposit setup and later accrual to execute as separate transactions. Advancing time within the same Foundry transaction does not reset that cache. The extra buffer covers share rounding without silently reducing required security; actual costs need an identified payer in the product.

Replay, using an archive-capable RPC if the public endpoint has pruned the block:

```sh
ROBINHOOD_FORK_PROOF=true ROBINHOOD_FORK_BLOCK=69829067 \
  forge test --offline --match-contract RobinhoodForkTest -vv
```

The original research block 69,695,660 was unavailable from the public RPC's historical state during implementation. Default unit runs explicitly skip network fork tests; do not count a skip as an integration pass. Changing the source block requires recording its new evidence. The fork source RPC can be configured with `ROBINHOOD_FORK_RPC`; its default is the official public endpoint.

## Integration boundaries

- Morpho V2 `max*` views return zero. `securityValue` and `releasableEarnings` are accounting bounds, not guaranteed available liquidity. Simulate the exact operation from the correct caller, then reconcile actual asset/share changes. In-kind exits and arbitrary allocator operations are outside this adapter.
- Deployments and dependencies must be reviewed and pinned by the application. A contract address from browser input is not an authorized tenancy. The adapter's read verifies asset/network/vault identity; deployment provenance remains the application's responsibility.
- Signed action fields must be shown to the user before signing. The durable server stores the plan, digest, signature and submitted hash. A timeout remains unresolved until chain observation; it is not permission to resubmit as a new operation.
- The TypeScript stock helper is fail-closed without approved 0x RWA access, a current eligible profile, an enabled instrument, and reviewed route/allowance targets. Quotes still require fresh simulation and a tenant signature. It never signs, submits, fabricates fills, or grants unlimited allowance.
- Robinhood Stock Tokens accumulate exposure using a multiplier. Chainlink prices already include that multiplier; REST underlying-equity prices do not. No second cash dividend is credited.
- No production wallet/provider account, stock purchase, fiat transfer, or production deployment was created here. Provider access, wallet recovery, complete fee sponsorship, actual stock execution/exit and production review remain integration gates.
